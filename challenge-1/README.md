UFSIT BLUE-TEAM-MOD-1/CHALLENGE-1
==================================

This is the first of two challenges from the September 17, 2014 meeting on networking, ncat, and Wireshark. Start at challenge1-start.pcap and find the IRC channel that the bad sheep hating henchmen of hasseo are hopping to! This virtual chase revolves around different IRC channels on Freenode.
